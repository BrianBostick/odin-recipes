   </ol>
   <h4>The Meat Sauce</h4>
   <ol>
    <li>Head olive oil over medium heat and add the dice onions. Let soften for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef and sausage. Increase heat to medium-high. Cook until cooked through, 8-10 minutes. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>

   </ol>
   <h4>Preheat Over and Cook Noodles</h4>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375F.</li>
    <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to be safe) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.</li>
    <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
   </ol>
   <h4>Assemble</h4>
   <ol>
    <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if necessary.</li>
    <li>spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 1/2 cups meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Top with 2 1/2 cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Spray foil with a nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
   </ol>
   <h4>Bake</h4>
   <ol>
    <li>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with cheesy garlic bread.</li>
   </ol>
